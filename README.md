```Kotlin
data class DeveloperProfile(
    val name: String,
    val pronouns: List<String>,
    val code: List<String>,
    val askMeAbout: List<String>,
    val technologies: Technologies,
    val architecture: List<String>,
    val currentFocus: String
)

data class Technologies(
    val backEnd: Map<String, List<String>>,

)

val amirhan = DeveloperProfile(
    name = "Amirhan",
    pronouns = listOf("he", "him"),
    code = listOf("C#", "Kotlin"),
    askMeAbout = listOf("competitive programming", "problem-solving", "researching"),
    technologies = Technologies(
        backEnd = mapOf(
            "C#" to listOf("ASP.Net Core", "Entity Framework"),
            "Kotlin" to listOf("Firebase")
        ),
